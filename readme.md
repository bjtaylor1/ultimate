# Ultimate

![.NET Core](https://github.com/bjtaylor1/ultimate/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

## Ultimate Dependency Injection Framework.

* Flexible
* Simple
* Open source - pull requests welcome
* Clear error messages that list type creation stack
* Circular reference detection
* Resolves `IEnumerable`s
* Inject temporary dependencies at runtime with `GetNestedContainer`

## Ultimate ORM
* Very simple
* You write the SQL - it just maps the `DbCommand` to either a single or multiple objects


These frameworks have been written purely for use in my own projects, and as such may not be fully comprehensive or cover all scenarios - however pull requests are welcome.
